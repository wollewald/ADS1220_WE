# ADS1220_WE

This is an Arduino library for the 24-bit, 4 channel ADS1220 ADC. I have tried to make it convenient and easy to use. All features of the ADS1220 have been implemented. The examples should help to understand how to use the functions.

If you like the library, it would be great if you could give a star. If you find bugs, please inform me.

On my website you find:

1) An article about the ADS1220 and the use of this library

2) An article how to use the ADS1220 for typical applications, such as thermocouples, NTCs, RTDs or Wheatstone bridges:

<h3>Known Issue</h3>

The sketch ADS1220_WE_two_devices_one_spi_interface.ino is not working with the Arduino UNO R4 Minima or the Arduino UNO R4 WiFi. Investigations are ongoing. The problem seems to be on the Arduino side and not on the lib side.
